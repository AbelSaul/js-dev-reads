## The problem :confused:

There are *a lot* of web development reading materials out there, from books to videos to blog posts. How can you know what is actually worth reading?

## Solution :sunglasses:

Here I have hand-picked web development/JavaScript books and articles I have personally read or have come highly recommended to me by other developers.

### Things to think about :thinking:

> Free books. Who doesn't like free books?! But if you are able, buy the book if it is offered as an option. No worries if you can't. But if it helps the devs continue to put out quality content then it is worth it.

### Note :exclamation:

> The stack most used in my list is React, GraphQL, and JavaScript, in no particular order. This is because it is the stack I am most familiar with. If you want to see Angular or Vue, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/twhite96/web-dev-must-reads/pulls). I would ask you to keep it to JavaScript technologies.
